You will get the statement that was executed in case you want to run the same query from within SSMS.
Each result set is displayed in its own grid.

You have a button to save the output to Excel and if you should forget where these Excel files are saved you can click another button which will open the folder where your Excel files are saved.

Each result set is saved in its own tab here as well along with the statement executed.

## Disclaimer:
I have tried to mimic the logic that is found within some of the stored procedures to some extent but not all logic that may be found in the stored procedures may be available in this application.

Example on logic that do exist:
If you for sp_BlitzFirst select [OutputType] = TOP10 the flag [SinceStartup] will automatically be set in the stored procedure. This will also happen in the application. 
And should you uncheck [SinceStartup] it will automatically be set when you click on [Execute].

Not all arguments available in the stored procedures may be available from within BlitzDesktop.
